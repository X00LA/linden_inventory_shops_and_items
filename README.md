# Items, Shops and Images for [linden_inventory](https://github.com/thelindat/linden_inventory)

This project is not finished and will be updated over time.

Some items are not in shops because I use them for other purposes. I didn't touch the weapon shops and the black market by now, will come soon.
The shops are optimized for [bt-target](https://github.com/OfficialNoms/bt-target) if you don't want to use it delete the corresponding values.
I use peds in my shops so the coords are optimized for that and bt-target. Some shops are not existent on your server because of missing MLOs.
I would provide a list with links, but I can't remember where I have it from. A lot are from the cfx-forum, GTA-Mods and some are paid ones.
And as I said before, it should be used as a reference not a drop and play thingy!

All messages for consumation and information are for [t-notify](https://github.com/TasoOneAsia/t-notify). If you want to use other notification style you have to change it.

I translated the item names to english but was too lazy to do the same with the messages for the notifications. (They are in german.)

All items have the matching prop attached and a matching animation (Potato Chips need overhaul). The positioning of the props need some fine tuning.

The images of the items are from linden_inventory and myself.

This resource is not meant as drop and play! It is a reference for those which struggle with ideas and or creation of items.

What items are included:

All beers that I'm aware of in GTA V.
All sodas in form of cans that I'm aware of in GTA V.
All alcohol that I'm aware of in GTA V.
Many different forms of coffe for the vending machine.
Lot of different food.
